                A map of my biography would illustrate better than anything the
                desire for learning and understanding that characterize my work.
                My starting point was a small town in northern Michigan. From
                there I achieved a BA in Comparative Cultures and Politics and
                German at Michigan State University; studied abroad in Cuba,
                Italy, and Germany; and then moved to Winter Park, CO to further
                pursue my passion for snowboarding. Coaching the WP Snowboard
                Team ended up being a perfect fit; I was afforded the unique
                opportunity to pursue a higher understanding of my passion
                professionally, and I fell in love with engaging this pursuit
                with a community.
                <br /><br />
                Learning full stack development with General Assembly has been
                reminiscent of many of these experiences. The pace and intensity
                driven by a desire for understanding reminds me of reaching a C1
                German proficiency level in one year at MSU. The collaborative
                learning and uplifting between instructors, classmates and
                myself makes me reflect on my role on both the Winter Park
                Snowboard Team and the Park City Snowboard Team. I now want to
                work professionally with a team that operates with these values
                in mind; goals for efficient solutions to complex problems,
                attained through teamwork and driven by curiosity and passion.
